First, we analyzed the Tom Sachs Rocket Components smart contract code: https://etherscan.io/address/0x11595ffb2d3612d810612e34bc1c2e6d6de55d26#code



The goal of this project is to build a working PoC demonstrating the ability to combine separate individual ERC-721 tokens to generate a new ERC-721.
The ability to combine separate immutable tokens has a plethora of entertainment and ownership potential. For example, the idea of playing with digital collecions of food by combining "ingredients" to generate "meals" may spark interest within the market of some NFT enthusiasts who adore the idea of 'owning' their own digital creations, built online by their own mouse and keyboard.

For the sake of our name, "Waifu Hunters," we've explored the idea of utilizing existing source code that allows users to tranform selfie photos into a anime-inspired character portrait befitting that of the user's preferences/looks from the real life selfie. By using this idea, we can then help the user morph (by using the power of combining various NFTs into a new one) a variation of their anime portraits with other ERC-721s that represent facial features, clothing, or other items. This ultimately generates an ideal digital end product that best satisfies the user's tastes: a cute unique anime selfie portrait representing them from a real-life photo.


For real value within one's daily life, the ability to own such "such-generated" NFTs can be used in secondary settings. These include digital portraits printed for physical collecting, market selling, video games, and more.
